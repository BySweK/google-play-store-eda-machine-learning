# Google Play Store – EDA & Machine Learning Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on exploring Google Play Store application data using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and applying a regression-based machine learning model to understand the factors affecting app-related metrics.

The primary goal is not only model performance but also understanding data limitations and interpreting results realistically.

---

## 🧱 Project Workflow

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Missing value analysis
- Feature engineering
- Train-test split
- Feature scaling
- Regression model training
- Model evaluation
- Interpretation of results and limitations

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📊 Model Evaluation

The regression model was evaluated using:
- R² Score

The model performance was relatively low, which highlighted important insights about data quality, feature representation, and model assumptions.

---

## ⚠️ Model Limitations & Learnings

- Limited feature representation affected model performance
- Linear regression assumptions may not fully capture the data structure
- Real-world datasets may require non-linear models or additional features

This project emphasizes analytical thinking and understanding model behavior rather than maximizing performance metrics.
